# GitHub ➡️ Forgejo Migration Script in Bash

This is a Bash script for migrating **all repositories** from a GitHub user account to a specified Forgejo instance.
It supports **mirroring** or one-time **cloning** and includes a cleanup feature for removing repositories on Forgejo that no longer exist on GitHub.

## Features

- Migrates all repositories for a GitHub user.
- Supports both **public** and **private** repositories.
- **Mirror mode**: repositories stay in sync with GitHub.
- **Clone mode**: one-time copy without ongoing sync.
- Optional cleanup of outdated mirrors on Forgejo.
- Fully terminal-interactive or configurable via environment variables.

## Requirements

- `bash`
- `curl`
- `jq`

## Usage

You can run the script directly:

```bash
./github-forgejo-migrate.sh
```

You will be prompted for required values unless you provide them via environment variables:

| Variable        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GITHUB_USER`   | GitHub username                                                             |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`  | GitHub access token (required for private repos)                            |
| `FORGEJO_URL`   | Full URL to your Forgejo instance (e.g., `https://forgejo.example.com`)     |
| `FORGEJO_USER`  | Forgejo username or organization to own the migrated repos                  |
| `FORGEJO_TOKEN` | Forgejo personal access token                                               |
| `STRATEGY`      | Either `mirror` (default) or `clone`                                        |
| `FORCE_SYNC`    | Set to `Yes` to delete Forgejo repos that no longer exist on GitHub         |

## What It Does

1. Fetches all repositories belonging to the specified GitHub user.
2. (Optional) Deletes any Forgejo mirrored repositories that no longer have a source on GitHub.
3. Migrates each repository to Forgejo using the selected strategy (`mirror` or `clone`).

## FAQ

### ❓ What is the difference between mirroring and cloning?

- **Mirroring**: Keeps the Forgejo repository in sync with the GitHub source.
- **Cloning**: Copies the repo once. No updates will occur after that.

### ❓ Can I migrate specific repositories?

Nope. This script is all or nothing. For selective migration, please use the Forgejo web interface.
